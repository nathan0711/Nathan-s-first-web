<p> <span style="font-size: 25px;">Outside of work, my passions keep me energized I thrive on helping teams be productive while maintaining a healthy work-life balance, but when I step away from that, you'll find me diving into my hobbies:</span>

<h1 style="border: 100px,">Gym</h1>
<h2>

    I've been dedicated to the gym for about seven years now, but my journey started with a simple goal—losing weight. Growing up, I struggled with obesity, and stepping into the gym was my way of taking control of my health. What started as a challenge quickly turned into a passion. After reaching my fitness goals, I realized the gym had become more than just a place to work out—it became a part of my lifestyle. Now, it's not just about staying in shape; it's about discipline, growth, and pushing myself to be better every day.

<h1>Bartender</h1>
<h2>I’ve been working as a bartender for about six months now, and what started as just a job quickly became something I truly enjoy. It never really feels like work—mixing drinks, creating new cocktails, and meeting different people every night has turned into a hobby I look forward to. There’s an art to bartending, from balancing flavors to perfecting presentation, and I love the creativity that comes with it. It’s not just about serving drinks; it’s about the atmosphere, the conversations, and the energy of the moment.</h2>
