    <h1>First Project</h1>
    <h2>
        "I’ve designed a personalized workout and diet plan that blends yoga with resistance training, which I call the Lean Body Workout. This routine requires just 3-4 sessions per week, making it easy to maintain while keeping the body strong, flexible, and energized. As for the diet, it’s all about balance—I believe in eating healthy without being too strict, allowing room to enjoy life while staying on track. It’s not just about looking good, but feeling good, staying active, and creating a sustainable lifestyle that supports both physical and mental well-being."

    <h1>Second Project</h1>
    <h2>
        "I created a special cocktail for Valentine’s Day called Strawberry Malibu at the place where I work. Inspired by the sweet and tropical flavors of Malibu rum and fresh strawberries, this drink is designed to be both refreshing and romantic. It’s the perfect blend of smooth, fruity, and slightly indulgent—making it a favorite for couples and anyone looking to celebrate the occasion with a little extra flair."
